                <p className="my-10">We are committed to protecting your personal information, 
                therefore, your personal information will be treated as strictly confidential. 
                If you want to use services via our Website, collection and processing of personal data could become necessary. 
                By using our sites, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. 
                Occasionally we may need to vary our privacy policy. 
                You should check our Website from time to time to view our most up to date privacy policy</p>

                <p className="my-10">We collect personal information directly from you when you:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc ml-10">

                you should only do so if you have their consent. 
                You must make sure that they have seen a copy of this privacy notice and are comfortable with you giving us their information. </p>

                <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold uppercase">Why do we collect personal information?</h1>

                <p className="my-10">The main reason we collect personal information is to enable us to provide you with the 
                Plan you intend to purchase or have purchased and to make sure we administer it correctly and efficiently. 
                Steps are taken to ensure the data we hold is accurate, 
                kept up to date and not kept for longer than is necessary. 
                Measures are taken to safeguard against unauthorised or unlawful processing and accidental loss or destruction or damage to the data. </p>

                <p className="my-10">However, if you believe the information we hold about you is factually incorrect, you can ask us to amend it. 
                In certain circumstances, you can ask us to stop using your personal information – for example if you think the personal information we hold may be inaccurate or you think we no longer need to process it. </p>
